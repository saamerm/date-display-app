Repository with a simple DateTime print, to enhance with Jenkins powered Kubernetes CI CD Tools

Part of a Slalom Toronto "Dev Ops Dojo" public event: https://github.com/slalomdojo/cicd

Participants were able to understand concepts of Master and Slave in Kubernetes, Jenkins and the usage of Docker.

Work here was done to 
* Checkout a GitHub repository containing a simple Node.js application
* Run a few tests
* Build a Docker image and push it to Dockerhub
* Deploy the application to Kubernetes using Helm (Kubernetes' package manager)
